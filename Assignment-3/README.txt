In the event that you are attempting to run some rule in the Prolog console, and only one result is coming up 
and not giving you the option to search for more with ;, please close the Prolog console and re-open the assignment. 
It should then allow you to run it and give the option to hit ; for more results. 
Consulting again in the same Prolog console does not work.
